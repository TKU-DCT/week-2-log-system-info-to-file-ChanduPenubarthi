- Prints the line to the terminal

Use GitHub Copilot to assist you â€” complete the TODO sections in `main.py`.

## Instructions

1. Accept the GitHub Classroom assignment
2. Open the repository in Codespaces
3. Open `main.py`
4. Use Copilot to fill in the missing code
5. Run the script multiple times
6. Check that `log.txt` is updated
7. Push your code to GitHub
